# AI Developer Requirements Document

## Purpose
This document outlines the user, functional, and system requirements for an AI developer who generates training data using web scraping. The goal is to address the challenges of categorizing training questions, ensuring data balance, and detecting biases to improve AI model performance.

## 1. Requirements Breakdown
Each section includes the **Requirement**, **Assumptions & Validation**, **Preliminary Tasks**, and the associated **Functional** and **System Requirements** to ensure clear connection between user needs, solution functionalities, and technical implementations.
The functional requirements describe what the system should provide to fulfill the AI developerâ€™s needs, while the system requirements describe the the underlying technical infrastructure enabling those functions.

### 1.1 Requirement: Automated Categorization of Training Data
**User Story:** As an AI developer, I want training questions to be automatically categorized by topic using metadata tagging so that I can easily organize and retrieve relevant data for model training.
