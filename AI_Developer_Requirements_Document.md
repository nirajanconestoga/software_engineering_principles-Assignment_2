  - Analyze misclassified entries to refine the categorization model.
  - Verify categorized datasets with subject matter experts.

 #### Preliminary Tasks
- Interview AI developers to identify pain points in manual categorization.
- Review inconsistencies in previous dataset tagging methods.
- Explore existing metadata standards and tools.

- If inadequate, implement the simplest technology solution such as open-source Python-based NLP models.

#### Functional Requirements (For AI Developers)
- The system shall allow users to upload datasets and automatically categorize training questions using metadata tags.
- The system shall provide an interface for users to review, edit, and approve categorized questions.
- Categorization shall achieve an F1-score of at least 85% on validation datasets.

#### System Requirements (Supporting Functionalities)
- The system shall use NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy) for implementing categorization models.
- Categorized data shall be stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for quick access by users.
- The backend shall handle batch uploads and provide retraining capabilities.

### 1.2 Requirement: Dataset Upload and Structured Storage
**User Story:** As an AI developer, I want to upload a dataset and have the system automatically structure and store categorized training questions so that I can efficiently retrieve and manage large volumes of data.

#### Assumptions & Validation
- **Assumption:** Structured storage with appropriate indexing will enhance data retrieval speeds.
- **Validation Methods:**
  - Test uploads with datasets up to 10 million entries.
  - Ensure retrieval times remain under 200ms during user queries.
  - Run concurrent upload and query stress tests.

#### Preliminary Tasks
- Interview AI developers about dataset storage challenges.
- Analyze inefficiencies in previous storage methods.
- Explore suitable indexing solutions.
- Consider a low-tech solution (e.g., structured CSV files).
- If inadequate, implement a technology solution such as Elasticsearch.

#### Functional Requirements (For AI Developers)
- Users shall be able to upload datasets through a web interface or API.
- The system shall automatically structure uploaded datasets for easy retrieval.
- Users shall retrieve categorized data with sub-200ms response times.

#### System Requirements (Supporting Functionalities)
- The system shall use Elasticsearch for fast search and retrieval.
- Data shall be stored using scalable solutions (e.g., AWS S3).
- Automatic indexing shall be triggered upon user uploads.

### 1.3 Requirement: Logical Separation of Questions and Answers
**User Story:** As an AI developer, I want training questions to be stored separately from answers so that I can ensure unbiased model training and independent validation of AI performance.

#### Assumptions & Validation
- **Assumption:** Separating questions and answers will reduce bias in model training.
- **Validation Methods:**
  - Inspect database structures to confirm separation.
  - Verify that users can independently retrieve questions or answers.
  - Compare model fairness before and after data separation.

#### Preliminary Tasks
- Interview users about issues caused by mixed data storage.
- Review and refine current storage solutions.
- Consider a low-tech solution (e.g., separate spreadsheets).
- If inadequate, implement a relational database solution with distinct tables.

#### Functional Requirements (For AI Developers)
- Users shall retrieve questions and answers separately through the interface.
- The system shall prevent cross-contamination of question and answer data during uploads.

#### System Requirements (Supporting Functionalities)
- PostgreSQL shall be used to store questions and answers in separate schemas.
- Data pipelines shall validate user uploads to ensure proper separation.

### 1.4 Requirement: Automated Bias Detection and Fairness Analysis
**User Story:** As an AI developer, I want to upload a dataset and receive a bias analysis report so that I can assess fairness before using the data for training.

#### Assumptions & Validation
- **Assumption:** Bias detection will identify demographic and contextual data biases.
- **Validation Methods:**
  - Compare reports with industry benchmarks.
  - Conduct user feedback sessions to validate report usefulness.

#### Preliminary Tasks
- Interview users to define necessary bias metrics.
- Review historical datasets for common bias patterns.
- Consider a manual review approach first.
- If insufficient, use automated detection tools (e.g., AIF360).

#### Functional Requirements (For AI Developers)
- Users shall upload datasets and receive downloadable bias analysis reports.
- The system shall present bias insights via interactive dashboards.

#### System Requirements (Supporting Functionalities)
- AIF360 and Fairlearn libraries shall power bias detection.
- Reports shall be exportable in PDF and JSON formats.
- Bias detection models shall auto-update for improved accuracy.
